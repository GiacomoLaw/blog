Hi all! I have decided to set up a smaller blog alongside [The Nerdy Student](http://thenerdystudent.com) for unrelated things and things about programming! It won't have a schedule, and will be updated every once in a while when I want to post.

I'll post intresting things I come across, challanges whilst programming, and other things I feel like posting.

I hope you enjoy! :)
