title: Using Public WiFi
---

Often hotel wifi wil require you to log in to allow you to use it, and lots of other public networks found around also require you to log in. Sometimes you want to be able to log in again in the wifi doesn't work, and if the login period expires you'll also need to log in again.

Many devices automatically bring up the login page, such as the popup on iOS, the alert on Android, and computers just opening their browsers. However, if you want to check that you are logged in again often its hard to remember what the url was. However, there is a much easier way.

You may be familiar with [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1), the url to your routers homepage. From here on your home network, you can log into the wifi and do various such as blacklisting, seeing whats using your wifi, device logs and more. However, by typing this into the hotel wifi it simply brings up the login url, and you can put your usernmae and password or whatever you used to login again.

With iOS, you'll want to disable auto-login so that the popup doesn't appear, as its quicker this way. Anroid just brings an alert up you can tap to redirect to this page, but once again its easier to simply go onto your browser and type in [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1).

**TL;DR**: Type [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) into your address bar when you next want to relogin onto public wifi and this brings up the login page.
