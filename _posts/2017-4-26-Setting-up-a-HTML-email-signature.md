title: Setting up a HTML email signature
---

I use email a lot when, probably more than anything else I use. I decided to make a HTML email signature for myself, but found that I couldn't put the raw code into the email, and have the email render it into a signature. However, there is an easy way to get around this.

After storing my signature code into a GitHub repo, I found a very useful site that allowed you to edit HTML, and see the results in real time. You can find it [here](http://htmledit.squarefree.com). 

It's pretty simple to get the resulting HTLM into the email signature - just highlight the preview and copy and paste it into your email app. In Gmail, you can just paste it straight into the signature box, and if you use [Spark for iPad and iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spark-love-your-email-again/id997102246?mt=8), you can select HTML and paste it in there. 

That's it! Now you have a lovely looking HTML signature. ðŸ™‚ 

Hope this helped!
